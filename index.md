## Agile case history (1)
]

.right-column[

### Story 1

>The case of a product that needs to be developed to the end, even if canceled by marketing and sales

* a big Gantt maintained weekly
* marketing and sales point of contact: maybe the product manager
* an internal team of strong individuals with roles
* a department that was said to be canceled
* all features *must* be develped 100%
* no budget, almost no constrains

]

.right-column[

### Story 1

>The case of a product that needs to be developed to the end, even if canceled by marketing and sales

What worked here:

* open discussion, try to help taking decisions

.left-column[
## Agile case history (3)
]

.right-column[

### Story 2

>The case of a product that needs to be developed, even if we don't know what - why - when

* moving deadlines
* evolving features list
* details only in one person's head
* fixed budget
* mandatory: win the tender

.right-column[

### Story 2

>The case of a product that needs to be developed, even if we don't know what - why - when

What worked here:

* sprint cycles
* client involved at each sprint
* write architectural details *for internal use*
* deliveries well described
* test plans
* shared git repository
